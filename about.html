                <p>Starting off as a slam project, Artificial Extinction was started in 2020 by Christian Moore with a guitar and "A dream to make Kick Ass Music" as he puts it. Although some songs were released under this formula, the project shifted towards grindcore with the addition of Chris Green on bass guitar. </p>

                <h5>Guitars, Vocals</h5>
                <p>Creating Artificial Extinction as a passion project in late 2020, Christian took on the position of guitarist, while doing vocals on recordings.
                    Later on, Christian would take on the full role as the front man of the band. Christian is a very influential element of Artificial Extinction's sound and style.
